# Remote Retro

Real-time retrospectives for distributed teams: collect ideas, group them on a shared
pan/zoom board (with optional Gemini assistance), label, vote, and leave with action items.

Built as a **Highbeam hackday** project: a ground-up rebuild of
[Remote Retro by Stride Consulting](https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro), the
original iteration this fork started from. Thanks to Stride for the idea and the years of
open-source work behind it.

Stack: Elixir 1.20 / Phoenix 1.8 / Postgres 17, React 19 + TypeScript + Redux Toolkit,
Tailwind v4 + daisyUI. Real-time over Phoenix Channels.

## Retro flow

`lobby → prime directive → idea generation → group & label → voting → action items → closed`

- The facilitator moves one stage forward or back; going back from `closed` re-opens the retro.
- **Group & label** has two views: the **board** — an unbounded canvas where you drag stickies
  so they overlap to form a group and label groups inline (pan by dragging empty space; zoom
  with ctrl/⌘-scroll, pinch, or the controls) — and a **list** for naming groups.
- With Gemini enabled, entering Group & label does a conservative first pass: only clearly
  related ideas are grouped, and a group gets a title only when an obvious one exists. Nothing
  is auto-labeled later; unlabeled groups stay unlabeled.
- Closing the retro emails its action items (with owners and a link back) to each participant,
  one message per person. Re-opening sends nothing; closing again only sends if the action items
  changed since the last email.

## Development

Everything runs in containers — no Elixir, Node or Postgres on your machine. You need Docker
([OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) or Docker Desktop).

```bash
cd docker-dev
docker compose up -d            # runs `mix setup`, then the app at http://localhost:4000
docker compose logs -f app
```

Compose starts Postgres 17 and an app container (Elixir 1.20 / OTP 28, Node 24). `deps/`,
`_build/`, `assets/node_modules/` and the database live in Docker volumes, not in your checkout.

**Database.** Local dev uses the shared **staging** database on Cloud SQL (through the
`staging-db` Cloud SQL Auth Proxy container) once `DEV_DATABASE_URL` is in `env.sh` — run
`deploy/setup-staging.sh` once to create it and write that line. Without it, dev falls back to
the local Postgres container. Tests always use the local container.

**Signing in.** In dev you can skip Google entirely:
`http://localhost:4000/dev/login?email=you@example.com` (optional `&name=…&picture=…`).

**Common commands** (from `docker-dev/`):

```bash
docker compose run --rm app mix test                                         # backend tests
docker compose run --rm app bash -c "cd assets && npm test && npm run typecheck"  # frontend tests
docker compose run --rm app mix format
docker compose exec app bash                                                  # shell in the running app
docker compose exec app mix ecto.migrate
```

**Email.** In dev nothing leaves the machine: closing a retro drops its emails into the
mailbox preview at http://localhost:4000/dev/mailbox.

**Teardown** (containers, volumes and the image):

```bash
docker compose down -v --rmi local
```

### Local configuration: `env.sh`

Put secrets in a gitignored `env.sh` at the repo root as `export KEY=value` lines. Compose
loads it into the app container automatically (no need to `source` it); restart with
`docker compose up -d --force-recreate app` after editing.

```bash
# Google sign-in (optional in dev — /dev/login works without it)
export REMOTE_RETRO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
export REMOTE_RETRO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export REMOTE_RETRO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/auth/google/callback

# Gemini grouping (optional)
export GCP_PROJECT=your-project-id
```

**Google sign-in:** create an OAuth client (type *Web application*) in the Google Cloud
Console under *APIs & Services → Credentials*, with authorized redirect URI
`http://localhost:4000/auth/google/callback`.

### Gemini (optional)

Gemini runs on Vertex AI using Application Default Credentials. The dev container reads them
from `~/.config/gcloud-remote-retro` (mounted read-only), kept separate from any other gcloud
identity you use. You don't need gcloud installed — run it in a throwaway container:

```bash
# 1. Sign in (prints a URL; open it, sign in, paste the code back)
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.config/gcloud-remote-retro:/root/.config/gcloud \
  gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:slim \
  gcloud auth application-default login --no-launch-browser

# 2. Bill Vertex usage to your project
docker run --rm -v ~/.config/gcloud-remote-retro:/root/.config/gcloud \
  gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/google-cloud-cli:slim \
  gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <PROJECT_ID>
```

On the project, enable the **Vertex AI API** and give the account you signed in with the
**Vertex AI User** role (`roles/aiplatform.user`). Then add `export GCP_PROJECT=<PROJECT_ID>`
to `env.sh` and recreate the app container. While Gemini works, the room shows an overlay
and blocks edits; if it fails or takes longer than 45s, the room unblocks and carries on.

## Configuration reference

| Env var | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `REMOTE_RETRO_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` / `_REDIRECT_URI` | Google sign-in |
| `GCP_PROJECT` | Enables Gemini grouping (unset = off) |
| `GCP_LOCATION` | Vertex AI location, default `global` |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Default `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | ADC file (service account, user, or impersonated). Set by the dev container; on Cloud Run omit it to use the attached service account |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Sends the action-items email on close (prod). Unset = emails are only logged, with a boot warning |
| `MAIL_FROM` | Sender, e.g. `"Remote Retro" <retro@example.com>`; default `"Remote Retro" <no-reply@remoteretro.local>` (warns in prod) |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY_BASE`, `PHX_HOST`, `PORT` | Standard Phoenix production settings |
